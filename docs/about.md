Gutenberg is being developed by the [Oxford Research Software Engineering team](https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk/).

The aim is to provide an interactive training environment for the delivery of courses on various software engineering concepts, at all levels.

The application consists of two key components:

- The course material.
- The tools to interact with it.

## Course Material

[Course material](https://github.com/UNIVERSE-HPC/course-material) is provided currently from the [HPC Universe Project](https://universe-hpc.github.io/) though this can reasonably be exchanged for any similarly styled sets of course material in the form of markdown files.
The structure of the markdown content is described in the HPC universe [contribution guide](https://github.com/UNIVERSE-HPC/course-material/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The course material which the application will use can be configured to be any git repository, or multiple repositories.

## Teaching Tools

The basic operation of Gutenberg is in the design and management of courses called Events;
Events are built from a collection of in person or remote lectures or labs with associated pages from the course material for students to work through.
Events are then shared with the students, who can enrol and then follow along, attending the lectures at the listed times and places. Instructors can monitor the progress of students as they complete embedded problems in the material.
In addition, students can provide feedback in the form of comments on the material, which are embedded threads in the appropriate pages, designed to report problems, have illuminating conversations about the material, or just comment on the concepts.

To see how to get started with Gutenberg, see our [deployment guide](/deployment.md).

For a introduction to using Gutenber to host an "event", see our [user guide](guide).
